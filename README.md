* Barriers for BYJU's
   * More than half of the respondents found the services expensive.
   * Aggressive marketing bids the students off 
   * Vedantu emerging as a cut-throat competition
* Triggers for BYJU's
   * Quality Education- Around half of the respondents admit that the quality of BYJU’s is satisfactory
   * Structured Course Material
   * Concept Clarity-The respondents believe that the teachers of BYJU’s are able to clear the concepts
